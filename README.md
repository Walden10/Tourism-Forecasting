# Tourism-Forecasting


This project makes use of public tourism arrivals data published by the Maldives Tourism Ministry on tourism arrival numbers to predict future tourism arrivals. The project also utilizes Google trends data to predict arrivals using relevant search intensity data (publicly published by Google). 

The project utilizes MIC (Maximal Information Criterion) to identify most relevant autoregressive and search data lags for prediction.

We implement Deep learning (Neural Networks) using tensorflow and keras to make predictions.

The following ML methods are trained and evaluated:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Regression
- XG Boost
- Deep Learning
- LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
